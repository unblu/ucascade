:jbake-title: Setup

== Setup

In order to interact with a given Gitlab instance through its REST API, `ucascade` needs to be authorized and authenticated. To do so, together with Gitlab's instance URL, an API token must be provided. 

In case merge-requests require one approval to be merged, an additional API token must be provided. If the merge-request author is allowed to approve its own merge-requests, both API tokens can be identical.

=== GitLab: Generate an API Token

You will need a https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html[personal access token] or a https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/settings/group_access_tokens.html[group access] in order for the tool to interact with your repositories on GitLab.

In addition, depending on the project's configuration, you might need an extra API token, which can be obtained in the same way as the first one.

All the actions are done using the REST API of GitLab.

You will need the `api` scope.

=== Application Setup

Some configurations are available for ucascade:

.Example `application.properties` file
----
gitlab.host=https://gitlab.com
gitlab.api.token=glpat-rXzx1n17cqUnmo437XSf
gitlab.api.token.approver=glpat-fGzx1n17cqUnmo437GGs
----

You can use any of the https://quarkus.io/guides/config-reference#configuration-sources[Configuration Sources supported by Quarkus] to set the values.
For example you can use following system property to set the `gitlab.api.token` value:

.Setting `gitlab.api.token` using a system property:
----
export GITLAB_API_TOKEN=glpat-rXzx1n17cqUnmo437XSf
----

==== GitLab host

Specify the location of the GitLab server:

* key: `gitlab.host`
* default value `https://gitlab.com`

==== GitLab api token

Specify the api token value used when ucascade is performing REST calls.

* key: `gitlab.api.token`
* No default value.
* Mandatory for the application to start

==== GitLab api token approver

Specify the api token value used when ucascade is approving a merge-request through a REST call.

* key: `gitlab.api.token.approver`
* No default value.
* If not set, `ucascade` will merge the merge-requests *without* approving them first. If set, `ucascade` will approve the merge-request using that value.

=== GitLab: Webhook Setup

In the corresponding repository or group configure a https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html[Webhook] pointing to the location where ucascade is available:

* URL: `<server url>/ucascade/merge-request`
* Trigger: `Merge request events`

WARNING: From an operational point of view, it might be safer to deploy ucascade to a server where only your GitLab instance has access.

=== Branches: Merge Model

As explained in the <<11_ucascade-configuration-file.adoc#Configuration file, configuration file section>>, in order to configure how the automatic merges are performed, a `JSON` file named `ucascade.json` must be present at the root of the project.

== Dev setup

The application can be started locally, check xref:50_build.adoc#local[local build] section.

=== Working with a remote GitLab instance

If you are working locally with a remote gitlab instance (like https://gitlab.com/), adding some proxy might be useful:

With a tool like https://ngrok.com/[ngrok] you will get a public url (something like `https://2a01-8943-19d-e0a-8b20-645f-f7a2-c2d-9be1.ngrok.io`) that points to your localhost computer.

.start ngrok (assuming ucascade is running locally on port 8080)
----
ngrok http 8080
----

With a tool like https://mitmproxy.org/[mitmproxy] you can proxy the remote instance to capture the REST requests made by ucascade to the remote instance:

.start mitmproxy
----
mitmproxy -p 8888 --mode reverse:https://gitlab.com
----

And then make ucascade use `localhost:8888` instead of `gitlab.com` directly:

.use mitmproxy
----
export GITLAB_HOST=http://localhost:8888
----
