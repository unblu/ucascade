== Endpoints

=== Main endpoint

`POST <server url>/ucascade/merge-request`

This is the principal endpoint, that receive the https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhook_events.html#merge-request-events[Merge Request Webhook event] sent by GitLab.

Requests are processed asynchronously, meaning that GitLab will receive a `202 Accepted` response back immediately.

Example:

[source, json]
----
include::ucascade-non-blocking-response.json[]
----

* `build_commit` and `build_timestamp` allow you to identify the ucascade version.
* `gitlab_event_uuid` is the value received in the `X-Gitlab-Event-UUID` header.

=== Blocking endpoint

A secondary endpoint where the process in done in a blocking way is available as well:

`POST <server url>/ucascade/merge-request-blocking`

With this blocking endpoint the different actions made by ucascade (see xref:30_technical-documentation.adoc[Technical documentation]) are visible in the returned response.

Example:

[source, json]
----
include::ucascade-blocking-response.json[]
----

Since GitLab keeps the response obtained when delivering a webhook event and displays it in the webhook admin page, using this endpoint might be interesting for debugging purpose.

=== Replay endpoint

An additional endpoint is available to trigger the process using some simplified input compared to the merge-request event body sent by the GitLab Webhook API.

`POST <server url>/ucascade/replay`

Body:

[source, json]
----
include::replay.json[]
----

The response is the same as in the blocking case.

Using this endpoint is interesting to trigger again the ucascade action for a given event using `curl`, without having to send the complete webhook event body.

=== Readiness and liveness probes

The application provides standard probes:

* `<server url>/q/health/live`: The application is up and running (liveness).
* `<server url>/q/health/ready`: The application is ready to serve requests (readiness).
* `<server url>/q/health`: Accumulating all health check procedures in the application.
